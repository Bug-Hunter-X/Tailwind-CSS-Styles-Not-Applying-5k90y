The problem was likely caused by an incorrect configuration in `tailwind.config.js` or the build process.   The `purge` option in the Tailwind configuration wasn't correctly identifying the files containing the Tailwind classes.  Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` file includes all the necessary directories or files where your components are located.  The following is an example of how it should be set up.  Also, ensure that you are importing Tailwind directives correctly in your main CSS file (usually `index.css` or `main.css`).

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    "../src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

By correctly configuring the `content` array, Tailwind can correctly scan and parse your files, enabling it to generate the required CSS for the classes you're using.
