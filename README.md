# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS styles fail to apply to a component despite seemingly correct implementation.  The component renders, but without any Tailwind styling.  The issue is investigated and a solution is provided.

## Bug Description

The core problem is that Tailwind CSS classes are not being picked up by the component, even though the necessary directives are present and class names are correct. No errors are thrown, which makes debugging challenging. 

## Setup and Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Observe the component; it renders, but without Tailwind styles applied.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the build process incorporates the necessary steps for generating and applying the Tailwind styles. Check the `bugSolution.js` file for the solution. This often involves reviewing your `tailwind.config.js`, verifying that your `purge` settings correctly include your components, and confirming that Tailwind's directives are included in your CSS file.
